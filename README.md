# Question for Java-Practical File(SEM-5) GTBIT
The main aim of creating this repository is helping the students in solving the questions in the java Practicals list as well as the extra questions given within the class. However, I would recommend everyone to **try and solve the questions on their own and refer to this repo only when necessary.** <br>
It is adviced to click `watch` on the repository so that you get notifications for all the programs added to the repository.
## About the code
All the codes have been made using *Eclipse(Neon) IDE for Java Developers* so that it is easy to import and run on any system.<br><br>Your can clone, download and import this project on *Eclipse IDE* or copy paste the code in any text editor if you are not familiar with the basics of Git  GitHub or Eclipse
## Structure of Code
Since some extra questions have been added by the Professor, threrefore to avoid any sort of confusion I have named every program according to it's aim rather than just numbering all the programs according to the list. Hence you need to refer the lsit of experiments to find out the required program.<br><br>
All the codes have been placed in the package `com.chanpreet`   
Some of the codes which require more than 1 class (example: `abstract classes` ) have been placed in a seperate package like `com.chanpreet.abstractClass`
